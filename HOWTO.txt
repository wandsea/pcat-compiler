    Locate routine_prefix at begining of gen.c

        e.g.  "_func" or "func" for subroutine named "func"

How to compile?
    $ make 

How to run?
    $ ./parser  /path/to/file.pcat # pcat -> asm
    $ ./compile /path/to/file.pcat # pcat -> asm -> native code 
    $ /path/to/file.pcat.o         # native code -> run
