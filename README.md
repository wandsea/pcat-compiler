pcat-compiler
=============
 
PCAT compiler is a college course project assigned in the course ''Compiler''
by Prof. Bo Yan, offered in Fudan University.

Students are required to implement an compiler of PCAT language, including
Lexical, syntax, semantic analysis and IR generation.


Architecture
------------


* Lexical Analysis (Tokenizer)

* Syntax Analysis

* Semantic Analysis

* IR Generation


Resources
---------

We didn't receive enough information and supplimentary materials from TA,
so we must search for it manually.

A [similar course](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~harry/compilers/syllabus.html) 
with project on PCAT was offered by 
[Prof. Harry H.Porter](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~harry/) in 2005.
Although in Java without solution, its supplimentary materials
as well as lectures closely linked to the PCAT compiler, still mean a lot
to us.

Another [course](http://lambda.uta.edu/cse5317/spring02/)
offered by Prof Fegras also contains PCAT compiler implementation
as it course project.
The [lecture note](http://lambda.uta.edu/cse5317/spring02/notes/notes.html)
provides good vision of knowledge required for this project, while 
instructions from [projects](http://lambda.uta.edu/cse5317/spring02/project.html)
explained some details on the implementation.

Students are required to implement an compiler of PCAT language, including
Lexical, syntax, semantic analysis and IR generation.

### IR Generation

Prof. Porter covered the SPARC architecture in 3 courses
([Part 1](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~harry/compilers/slides/SPARC-Part1.pdf),
[Part 2](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~harry/compilers/slides/SPARC-Part2.pdf)
and
[Part 3](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~harry/compilers/slides/SPARC-Part3.pdf)),
then covered Code Generation([Part 1](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~harry/compilers/slides/CodeGen1.pdf),
[Part 2](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~harry/compilers/slides/CodeGen2.pdf),
[Part 3](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~harry/compilers/slides/CodeGen3.pdf)),
